Learn how to add more advanced functionality, like minting, burning, and bonding curves to a base ERC20-like contract.

### Host

Ethan Frey ‚Äì CEO / Founder, Confio | CosmWasm

### Resources

We will be coding some basic token contracts in Rust to deploy on the CosmWasm testnet.

We ask that all participants have previously [installed Rust](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/rust-basics) and have set up the IDE of their choice with a Rust extension. 

We will not be covering the basic structure of the CosmWasm contract in much detail. If you have no experience with CosmWasm, please go through the [tutorial](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/intro) which explains step-by-step how to modify a simple escrow contract. This will also ensure you have all pre-requisite tooling set up.

We will be starting with some example token code that Ethan Frey wrote [cosmwasm-plus](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm-plus), explaining the design and how it works. And we will extend those basic contracts to create customized tokens, as an intro into DeFi on CosmWasm.

We also hope to schedule a follow-up workshop to show how to build custom web interfaces (dApps) to interact with the contracts.

At Tendermint, we‚Äôve built Starport, a rapid prototyping tool that lets developers scaffold and launch a Cosmos application in minutes. In this tutorial we will be building a simple poll application based on Cosmos SDK. The app will allow signed in users to create polls (creating a poll will cost tokens), cast votes and see the results in a browser-based UI. We will be using Starport CLI to scaffold the code and launch the app and some JavaScript to wire up the UI. This is a beginner-friendly session that doesn‚Äôt require any prior knowledge of Cosmos SDK (only some experience with Go or JS, and a Unix-like console).
